    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    1. INSTALLATION
     
    1.1 Install Directory
          
    Make sure that the entire package is installed in a directory
    called "ffa_format". The directory structure is -
     
       ffa_format/*
                  manual/
                         ffa-data/*                                
                         html/*
             
    
    1.2 Path Setup
    
    Set up your system so that the installation directory "ffa_format" is
    on the Matlab path. You can do this using the Matlab command "addpath" 
    in your "startup.m" file. If you are using Matlab 6+ you should add
    a command to set the root property "RecursionLimit". 
    
    Example startup.m 
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------   
      addpath /home/kalle/matlab/ffa_format 
      fprintf('  For info on FFA-format tools type: ffa or ffa_helpdesk \n\n')
      set(0,'RecursionLimit',4096);  
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   
    You can also set-up the Matlab path using the environment variable
    MATLABPATH - with a suitable command in one of your login scripts   
   
   
    1.4 On-line Manual
    
    The browser-based on-line help files are stored in the directory

      ffa_format/manual/html
    
    The file "index.html" in this directory can be opened in any browser.
    
    There is a ready-made Matlab command to open this manual "ffa_helpdesk"
    however, you may need to change the BROWSER definition in this to suit 
    your system. The standard browser is "konqueror" for Linux with KDE.
       
    
    2. GETTING STARTED
  
    If you have installed the package correctly (see above) you should
    be able to get all the information you need by using the on-line help.
    
    Start Matlab(*) and then use any one of these on-line help commands.
    
    >> ffa_helpdesk                 % opens the browser-based manual
    
    >> ffa                          % prints a single-page intro text 
    
    >> help ffa                     % ""  ""  same as previous command
    
    >> help ffa_format              % prints the text in "Contents.m"
    
    You can also get help on any one "ffa_" function using the standard
    Matlab help command, for example
    
    >> help ffa_load 
    
    The best way to learn how to use this toolbox is to load up some FFA-
    format data from a file and then try out some of the "ffa_" functions.
    
    A sample FFA-format data file is provided. An easy way to get at this 
    is to use the "ffa_helpdesk" command. To find out how, enter this
    
    >> help ffa_helpdesk
